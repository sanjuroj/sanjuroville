##Sanjuroville Frontend

This repository contains the front end of my [website](www.sanjuro.net).  I had originally thought to create separate repos for each "app" that I was building but that was becoming a hassle.  If any single app becomes something that makes sense to publish as a standalone package, I'll split it out at that time.  

For now, the only page that required any consequential coding was the resume page.  By default it shows my experience chronologically in a compact format.  The display can be reconfigured using a set of control buttons at the top of the page.  

This front-end app relies on the data being available through a Django API, which is in a different [github repository](https://github.com/sanjuroj/sanjuroville-backend).
