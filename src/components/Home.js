                 HI! I'm Sanjuro and this is my site.  I'm a web developer based in Portland, Oregon, which you might not guess based on this sad little website.  But who has time for personal projects?  Apparently not me.  I do have ambitions to build things so you might check back in a year or two to see if anything has changed.
